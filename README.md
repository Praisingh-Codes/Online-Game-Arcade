## Future scope

<div align="justify">
The Web Arcade platform offers considerable potential for future development and expansion. As user expectations and digital entertainment technologies continue to evolve, the platform can be enhanced with a broader game library, user account features for saving progress and tracking achievements, and social functionalities such as leaderboards, multiplayer support, and community interaction. Cross-device synchronization can further improve accessibility by allowing seamless gameplay across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Incorporating artificial intelligence can introduce adaptive gameplay and smarter in-game opponents, while cloud gaming integration could enable high-performance experiences without reliance on local hardware. Additionally, the adoption of emerging technologies like Virtual and Augmented Reality could provide immersive and interactive gaming environments. In the long term, monetization strategies such as ad integration, premium content, or in-app purchases can help sustain platform growth. With these enhancements, Web Arcade is well-positioned to evolve into a dynamic, user-centric gaming ecosystem that redefines casual browser-based gaming.
